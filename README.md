# Leveraging routinely collected data to derive individualized perioperative risk profiles for different outcome categories.

This repository contains code for the bachelor's thesis of Noel Kronenberg at the Institute of Medical Informatics at Charité. It comprises all important components that have been combined into this one repository for reference, as part of the components will see future development not included in the thesis.

## Structure

- ```corr_utils```: Python package for working with the CORR (Charité Outcomes Research Repository)
- ```data```: Static files for the analyses (note that sensitive files have been removed)
- ```prototype```: A prototype for visualizing the risk scores
- ```figures.ipynb```: Notebook for the creation of figures
- ```scores.ipynb```: Notebook for the central analyses performed as part of the thesis
- ```subphenotypes.ipynb```: Notebook for the previous study named “Multimorbiditätscluster und
Mortalität bei intensivpflichtigen perioperativen Patient:innen” (submitted for publication), building on work of the thesis
